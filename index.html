        1 Blessed is the one
        who does not walk in step with the wicked
        or stand in the way that sinners take
        or sit in the company of mockers,
      </p>

        2 but whose delight is in the law of the Lord,
            and who meditates on his law day and night.

        3 That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
            which yields its fruit in season
        and whose leaf does not witherâ€”
            whatever they do prospers.

        4 Not so the wicked!
            They are like chaff
            that the wind blows away.

        5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
            nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        6 For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous,
            but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
